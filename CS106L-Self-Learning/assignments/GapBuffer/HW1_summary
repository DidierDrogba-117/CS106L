HW1 Summary:
In this assignment, I focused on key C++ concepts for improving code efficiency and structure:

Member Initialization List: This approach is more efficient than default initialization followed by reassignment, ensuring better performance, especially with multiple member variables.

Const vs. Non-Const Functions: I used const_cast to avoid duplicating code between const and non-const member functions, maintaining clean, reusable code.

Iterators: I practiced using iterators to traverse containers like std::vector, ensuring efficient, standard iteration.

Move Semantics: I learned about move constructors and move assignment operators, which enable efficient resource management by transferring ownership without unnecessary copying, key for performance optimization.
